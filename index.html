<h2><center> Welcome to the Heath AFM Lab research website</h2> <br /> </center>
<p> We perform and develop high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) to study the dynamics of proteins, lipids and other biomolecules.
HS-AFM is a powerful tool for studying the surface properties of biomaterials across lengthscales. 
 Currently methods allow high-speed imaging at 70 frames per second, line scanning at milisecond timescales and single point recordings (Height Spectroscopy) at microseconds resolution.
 We have also developed methods to improve spatial resolution down to 4Ã….
