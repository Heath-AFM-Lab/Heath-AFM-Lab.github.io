<h2><center> Welcome to the Heath AFM Lab research website</h2> <br /> </center>
<p> We perform and develop high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) to study the dynamics of proteins, lipids and other biomolecules.
HS-AFM is a powerful tool for studying the surface properties of biomaterials across lengthscales. 
 Currently methods allow high-speed imaging at 70 frames per second, line scanning at milisecond timescales and single point recordings (Height Spectroscopy) at microseconds resolution.
 We have also developed methods to improve spatial resolution down to 4Ã….

   <h2> New Lab Webpage  </h2>
   <p>Sure! Here is a sample blog post about a new lab webpage:

Hello everyone,
 <br /> 
I am excited to announce the launch of our new lab webpage! 
Check out the different sections to learn about the team and various projects that we are currently pursuing.
    View the gallery to see some of the recent videos generated by our research. 
    See the software section to find links to analysis tools.
If you have any feedback or suggestions for how we can improve our website, please don't hesitate to let us know.
Thank you for your continued support of our lab, and I hope you enjoy our new webpage!</p>
