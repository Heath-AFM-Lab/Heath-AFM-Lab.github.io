Open codes developed for analyzing AFM data. More codes coming soon...

## [Simulation AFM](https://github.com/George-R-Heath/Mat-SimAFM)
A Matlab app and code that generates Simulated AFM images using 3D coordinates and a user defined AFM tip geometry. Coordinates can be read using various file types including .pdb .txt, or .csv files.

## [AFM LineScan Analyzer](https://github.com/George-R-Heath/AFM-LineScan-Analyser)
MATLAB codes to track and analyze single molecule dynamics in AFM Line Scan Kymographs.

## [Correlate Filaments](https://github.com/George-R-Heath/Correlate-Filaments)
Matlab codes used to straighten and align filament/fibril/polymer features such as helical repeats in image files.
